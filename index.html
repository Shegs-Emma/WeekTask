                <h3>git PUSH</h3>
                <p>The <i>git push</i> command is by far my favourite git command, this is because a successful push guarantees the
                safety of my code no matter that happens to my device!</p>
                <p>
                    The <i>git push</i> command allows you to send the commits from your local branch in your local repository, to the
                    remote repository on Github. To be able to push to your remote repository, you must ensure all files in the local
                    has been committed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The command's syntax is as follows: <br /> <i>git push (repo_name) (branch_name)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a number of different options you can pass with the command, a few of them has been discussed in the new
                    bucket just on your right.

                <h3>Arguments / Flags</h3>
                <p>
                    It should be noted, that before you can push to a particular remote repo, you must have cloned that repo,
                    or better still, you must <i>pull</i> before you then push. With that said, let's move on.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        --all: This flag can be used thus: <br /> <i>git push --all (remote_name).</i><br /> This flag signals that
                        you want to push all branches to the remote repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        --force: This flag can be used thus: <br /><i>git push --force (remote_name) (branch_name).</i> The flag
                        to ignore the local changes made to Git repository at Github(Which most of developers do for a hot fix to 
                        development server) then you can use —force command to push by ignoring those changs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        --no-verify: This flag can be used thus: <br /><i>git push --no-verify.</i> By default git push will trigger 
                        the --verify toggle. This means that git will execute any client-side pre-push script that may have been 
                        configured. If the pre-push scripts fails, so will the git push. (Pre-Push hooks are good for doing things 
                        like, checking if commit messages confirm to company standards, run unit tests etc…). Occasionally you may 
                        wish to ignore this default behavior e.g. in the scenario where you wish to push your changes to a feature 
                        branch for another contributor to pull, but your work-in-progress changes are breaking unit tests. To ignore 
                        the hook, simply input your push command and add the flag --no-verify.
